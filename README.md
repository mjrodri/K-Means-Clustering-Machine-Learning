# K-Means Clustering Project

This Python project uses the scikit-learn library to implement K-Means clustering on a sample dataset. It serves as a foundational example for understanding the implementation of K-Means clustering in Python.

## Overview

### Objective:
The goal of this project is to demonstrate K-Means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm, on a simple dataset.

### Steps:
1. **Generate Sample Data:**
   - Create a small dataset for demonstration purposes.

2. **Visualize the Data:**
   - Plot the original data points to visually understand their distribution.

3. **Apply K-Means Clustering:**
   - Use the K-Means algorithm to cluster the data into a specified number of clusters.

4. **Get Cluster Centers and Labels:**
   - Obtain the cluster centers and labels assigned to each data point by the K-Means algorithm.

5. **Visualize Clusters:**
   - Plot the clustered data, marking each data point with its assigned cluster, and display the cluster centers.

### Key Components:
- **NumPy Array (`X`):**
  - Represents the dataset containing coordinates of data points.

- **K-Means Clustering:**
  - Utilizes the scikit-learn implementation of K-Means to group data points into clusters.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Uses Matplotlib to visualize both the original and clustered datasets.

## Usage

Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kmeans-clustering.git
   cd kmeans-clustering

Install the required dependencies:

pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Run the Python script:


python kmeans_clustering.py
Experiment with different numbers of clusters by adjusting the k variable in the script.
